Then here\\\\\\'s your chance to be a Data Scientist Intern on the Research and Development team at HCSS!  Being a software company in the construction realm, we\\\\\\'re constantly innovating and playing with the latest tools, providing high quality support for our customers while providing a great work-life balance for our employees.  What are you expected to do?   Participate in efforts to create software to perform data analysis that will include: Artificial Intelligence modeling Data mining Designing and implementing deployment to include API  Requirements:  Knowledge of Python programing Familiarity with AI modeling libraries like TensorFlow and Keras Familiarity with query languages like SQL During the time of your internship, you must be enrolled in an accredited college/university and be able to commute to our office (Sugar Land, TX).  What to expect:  You must be able to work at least 15 hours a week (preferably more up to 25 hours). We\\\\\\'ll work around your school schedule. Depending on your performance, you can join us full-time upon graduation. If you need to take a break, go exercise or play some games with your co-workers! We have an arcade room, a mini gym, a track and field and more free for our employees to use. Training will be provided and you\\\\\\'ll receive regular feedback to your performance.  Did we mention that we\\\\\\'ll pay you too? That\\\\\\'s money towards your student loans, a fun night out in town, or for your next trip abroad! Where else can you find all this besides at a \"Best Company to Work for in Texas\"? Join us today now!   Note:  Part of our recruitment process includes a math/logic test. HCSS will send you an email within the week after you apply with the test link. In case this is not in your inbox, please also check your spam/junk mail folder.
